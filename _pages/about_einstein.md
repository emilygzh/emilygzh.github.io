Hi there, Iâ€™m Emily! 

I'm passionate about STEM outreach, sparking meaningful conversation, and chasing dreams. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello and piano, trying new [restaurants](https://beli.co/app/fastandmcflurrious), learning about dinosaurs and rocks, sewing, reading, [running](https://strava.app.link/XvX7oP1u8Qb), and exploring the outdoors with my [camera](https://emilygzh.github.io/clickshack/).
