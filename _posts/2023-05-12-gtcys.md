</div>
I joined Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphonies (GTCYS) as a 5th grader, and returned in my junior year of high school. 

I owe my love for music to GTCYS-- an appreciation I gained through the rigorous repertoire we performed and the countless opportunities the program offered. We filmed a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpaPf7izQds) with Phil Thompson, [toured Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAKY2f4N8nY), and rehearsed weekly in Orchestra Hall. I grew as a musician, a student, an individual, and found a family I will forever cherish. 

For my last concert as a GTCYS musician, I had the opportunity to open as a student speaker. I speak at 00:00:49, and my orchestra performs at 01:15:30.

I wouldn't trade my time with this program for the world. Thank you, GTCYS.

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
