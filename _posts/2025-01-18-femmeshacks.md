FEMMES+ (Females and Allies Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science) is an incredible program at Duke, dedicated to igniting curiosity and confidence in STEM among young students in our local community. We're comprised of many student volunteers at Duke, and reach hundreds of youth every year. 

This past year, I had the privilige of serving as co-director for our Hackathon program. Our program grew twice in size (our biggest ever cohort!), we launched new learning tracks (cybersecurity and game dev), and piloted small-group discussions that connected students with professionals in both industry and academia. Check out photos from the day [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EJw16oSibcVaJYeCA)! 

Onto the 8th ~
