FEMMES+ (Females and Allies Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science) is an incredible program. We're comprised of many student volunteers at Duke, and reach hundreds of youth in our local community. 

This past year, I had the privilige of serving as co-director for our Hackathon program. Our program grew twice in size (our biggest ever cohort!), we launched new tracks, and piloted small-group industry/academia mentorship groups. Check out photos from the day [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EJw16oSibcVaJYeCA)! 

Onto the 8th!
