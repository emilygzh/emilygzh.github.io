FEMMES+ (Females and Allies Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science) is an incredible program. We're comprised of many student volunteers at Duke, and reach hundreds of youth in our local community. 

This past year, I had the privilige of serving as co-director for our Hackathon program! 

This year, our program grew twice in size (our biggest ever cohort!), we launched new tracks, and piloted small-group industry/academia mentorship groups.

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
